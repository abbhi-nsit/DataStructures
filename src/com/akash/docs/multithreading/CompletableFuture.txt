CompletionStage
A stage of a possibly asynchronous computation, that performs an action or computes a value when another CompletionStage completes.
 A stage completes upon termination of its computation, but this may in turn trigger other dependent stages.
 
 
 The computation performed by a stage may be expressed as a Function, Consumer, or Runnable
