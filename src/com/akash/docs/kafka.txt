---------------------------------------


1 topic has various partitions
each partition can be replicated on various servers
for a partition, one server can act as leader and other as follower
If one leader fails, one of the follower will become leader

producer decides which message is transferred to which partition of the topic

queueing : message stores the info about which consumer they have to sent 

publisher-subscriber : message is sent to all subscribers who are registered with a particular pipeline

kafka : partition contains info about subscriber to which message to be sent,one topic may have various partitions

ordering of messages is maintained per partition
If we want a total ordering of messages,then this can be achieved by having one partition in a topic.
