Dynamic Programming :

Careful brute force = execute all scenarios carefully
Exhaustive search in a clever way
subproblems + reuse

(Q)How DP is related to divide and conquer :

Divide and Conquer algorithms partition the problem into DISJOINT subproblems.
i.e. no subproblem overlaps.

DP is applied when subproblems overlaps,
i.e. two or more subproblems share same subsubproblems.

It computes a subproblem just once and stores it in an answer table.
By this it avoids the cost recomputing the same subproblem.

properties of Dynamic programming :

=>Overlapping subproblems :
When subproblems of a problem are not disjoint
i.e. subproblem share subsubproblems
solutions to these subproblems are stored and reused further

=>Optimal Substructure : 
Optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to its related subproblems, which may be solved independently.
