=>Array Rotations :

rotate array by d elements
	->gcd way
	->left reversal algo
	->right reversal algo
find pivot element in sorted and rotated array
find sum of pair of numbers in sorted and rotated array
majority element	-> hashmap, moore voting algo
Lexicographically minimum string rotation	-> array of size 26,count occurence of character from A-Z
Rotate Matrix Elements (shift all elements by 1)
Print a given matrix in spiral form
Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees -> rotate -> transpose
--TODO--Rotate each ring of matrix anticlockwise by K elements
Check if all rows of a matrix are circular rotations of each other -> append array to array itself
Minimum rotations required to get the same string -> same as above
Check if strings are rotations of each other or not
Count rotations divisible by 4


Rearrange an array such that arr[i] = i
Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end
Rearrange array such that arr[i] >= arr[j] if i is even and arr[i]<=arr[j] if i is odd and j < i
Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion
Rearrange array in alternating positive & negative items with O(1) extra space
Rearrange array such that even positioned are greater than odd
Arrange given numbers to form the biggest number
