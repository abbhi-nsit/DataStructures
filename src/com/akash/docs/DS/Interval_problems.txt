Given list of intervals , array of arrival and array of departure

A-> check if there is any conflict in intervals
	Check if any two intervals overlap among a given set of intervals
B-> train arrival and departure times are given, find minimum number of platforms required
	Minimum Number of Platforms Required for a Railway/Bus Station
	Find the point where maximum intervals overlap
C-> Merge Overlapping Intervals
D-> Given n appointments, find all conflicting appointments
E-> Activity Selection problem
 

Solution
(1) compare every interval with every other interval
	A,B,D,E
	worst case time = O(N^2)
	
(2) use interval search tree
	conflicting intervals can be checked and removed
	A,E
	worst case time = O(N^2)
	
(3) sort arr and dep array
	if i->i-1 is a conflict
	then check i->i-2 upto i->0
	A,B,D,E
	worst case time = O(N.logN)
	
(4) store time stamp in an array
	1..24
	for every interval, add 1 to that interval array indexes
	A,B,D,E

(5) multi map
	
	
** Activity Selection problem
	-> greedy approach 
	-> if departure array is sorted, then time = O(N)
