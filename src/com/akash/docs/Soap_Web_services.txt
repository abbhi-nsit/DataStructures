Soap Web Services:

Simple Object Access protocol

Web services are different from RMI that it makes language neutrality.

A good web Service should have following features:
(1)Loosely coupled				--	one call must be independent to other and do not know the internal working
(2)All calls must be stateless	--	no instance variable,only static or final variable

**JAXB component:
Java Architecture for XML Binding

marshalling unmarshalling

marshall 	=>	memory object (java object) --> document(xml)
unmarshall 	=> 	document (xml) --> memory object (java object)


**There are some java tools which can also perform this operation:
schemagen	=>  java annotated class  -->  XML schema
xjc			=>  XML schema -->	Java annotated class
wsimport	=>	WSDL --> Stub classes 	(at client side)


Features of SOAP :
(1)Transport Neutral
(2)Only works with XML
(3)Every SOAP Request and SOAP Response object is a JAXB artifact.
(4)Every Soap web Service has an Endpoint which needs to be published.
	Endpoints are published with a specified url-pattern
	http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jax-ws/ri/runtime helps to publish an endpoint.
	It requires an endpoint name, url pattern, implementation class,handlers (if required).
(5)Handlers : before going for actual operation in Service, handlers are created to process incoming and outgoing data.
			Handlers are provided both at client and Server side.
			advantages : validate data,modify data, print data
			implement SOAPHandler interface
(6)Every namespace file is identified by its targetNamespace
(7)Soap message contains one Envelope. Envelope consists of 
	header,body,fault,attachment
(8)Code first and Contract first are two ways to create SOAP web services.
	Code first 		: Java code is written first and then wsdl is generated.
	Contract first 	: WSDL is written first and then java code is generated.
(9)get schema for Service 	= endpointUrl?xsd=1
	get wsdl for Service 	= endpointUrl?wsdl
(10)WSDL consists of:
	Definition	:main tag of wsdl file.all tags are child of this.used to import any xsd.
	types		:
	message		:complex types like request and response types
	portType	:one wsdl has one portType.portType contains all operations(req-res pair)
	binding		:provides implementation details eg: transport layer protocol http,smtp
	service		:combination of portType + binding
	

While registering JAX-ws in java for SOAP:
-->WSServletContextListener regiter it in web.xml
		Parses sun-jaxws.xml and sets up HttpAdapters for all deployed endpoints.
-->WSServlet
		JAX-WS dispatcher servlet.
