Methods of Session class

get()
load()

save()
persist()

update()
saveOrUpdate()
merge()

delete()


Methods of EntityManager

find()
persist()
merge()
remove()

(Q)Difference b/w merge() and update() ?
Ans : 
update will fire only one sql for update
merge will first fire select (if entity is not loaded) and then update

update will throw exception if identifier not found
merge will add a new row if identifier not found

(Q)Difference b/w get() and load() ?
Ans :
When an entity already exists in DB we should use load()
It first checks in session cache then in DB.
if not found it throws exception
load() will return a proxied object.

get() can be used to check if entity exists in DB or not.
It returns null if not found


(Q)What is N+1 problem and how to resolve it ?
Ans :
There may be a scenario where we fetch an object and its children are fetch after that
As a result , their will be N+1 sql queries.
1 parent object can have N children
1 for the parent and
N for the children

To solve this we can load all entities in single sql as :
SELECT parent LEFT OUTER JOIN child

this query can also be used in HQL as :
FROM parent JOIN FETCH child 

NOTE : we can use this logic whenever we have to load full object graph.

(Q)Difference b/w save() and persist() ?
persist() method saves entities and their children inside a transaction.
persist() method throws TransactionRequiredException when it is used outside transaction

save() method can be used outside transaction, but then it will not save children entities.

save() with transaction ==== persist()

(Q)saveOrUpdate

It can be used outside transaction.
If used outside transaction then only parent entity saved.

NOTE : save() and saveOrUpdate() if used outside transaction, and you want to save mapped entities,
		you have to use session.flush()
		
Things that save data to DB :
(1)session.flush()
(2)transaction.commit()
(3)fire a DDL command, all queries before DDL command will be committed.
(4)fire HQL select command, all previous queries that include in SELECT HQL are commited.


Object is part of persistent context and tracked for any changes:
save()
saveOrUpdate()
merge()
update()
persist()

NOTE : One SessionFactory object is created for each Data source.
