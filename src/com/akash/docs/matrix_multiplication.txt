matrix multiplication:

A[n x m] X B [m x p]  = C[n x p]

Why matrix multiplication is done in this way?
What is the advantage of matrix multiplication?
What is the meaning of determinant of a matrix?
What is the meaning of tranpose of a matrix?

======================


n-D matrix multiplication depicts the n dimensional transformation

if we multiply a number line by -2, every number gets multiplied by -1 and expanded as twice.

Now considering the case of 2 D
we track the transformation of two coordinates : (1,0) and (0,1)

x	=	x * 1  +  y * 0
y           0         1


lets say there is a transformation of (0,1) to (a,c)
and a transformation of (1,0) to (b,d)

then this x-y plane can be depicted as a matrix transformation of 

A =  a  b
     c  d

x * A  =  ax  by
y         cx  dy

for example :

let say after a transformation :
(1,0) -- shifted to (1,-2)
(0,1) -- shifted to (3,0)

1  -2
3   0
