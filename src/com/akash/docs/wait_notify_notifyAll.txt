Wait Notify NotifyAll

These concepts are used for communication between multiple threads sharing same resource.
Inter Threaded communication.

Serialization solves the problem of memory inconsistencies but
 We also want our shared resource to be used wisely.

final void wait( ) throws InterruptedException 
final void notify( ) 
final void notifyAll( )

wait() : tells the current thread to go in sleep mode and removing lock from objects monitor
		(if object lock is held in synchronized block).
		It comes out of sleep when some other thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on same monitor 
		OR
		some other thread interrupt this current thread.
notify() : removes the first thread from sleep mode.
notifyAll() : removes all threads from sleep mode.

If wait() was called in synchronized block then after coming from sleep mode
 it again gains monitor(depending on its priority).

(Q)Why suspend() and resume() methods are deprecated?
suspend() method do not release monitor from the object and that may result in deadlock,
if suspend method is called from a synchronized block.

(Q)Why wait() notify() and notifyAll() methods are in Object class?
These methods are used either to get or remove object's monitor.
The object that is shared with different threads.

Note : wait(0) == wait(0,0) == wait()

Three stages of a thread:
(1)Runnable pool
(2)Running
(3)Blocked pool
