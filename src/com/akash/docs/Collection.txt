Collection

(1)Every implementation of Collection have atleast following two constructors
public className(){}
public className(Collection e){}  // to copy all elements to new collection

 There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) 
 but all of the general-purpose Collection implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.
 
(2)If any operation is unsupported for any implementation,then may/may not throw unSupportedException
or any other checked exception

(3)Each implementation determines its own synchronization policy.


Note that Iterator.remove is the only safe way to modify a collection during iteration; 
the behavior is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified in any other way while the iteration is in progress.

Iterable (I)
Collection (I)
-->Set		 == do not allow duplicate,allow single null,do not maintain ordering	==  HashSet,LinkedHashSet
-->List		 == maintain insertion order,allow duplicate,allow null		==  LinkedList,ArrayList,Vector
-->SortedSet == elements are in sorted order,do not allow duplicate		==  TreeSet

-->Map		 == maintains key value pair								==  HashMap,LinkedHashMap
-->SortedMap == maintains key value pair,elements are sorted 			==  TreeMap

===============================================

Iterator,ListIterator,Enumeration

Iterator Design Pattern
****Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying represenation.

Iterator and ListIterator provides a way to traverse or modify a collection.
ListIterator is child class of Iterator.

Collection -> Iterator
List       -> ListIterator,Iterator

ListIterator also provides traversing back or forward.
Iterator only provides forward.

=>Iterator
hasNext()
next()
remove()

=>ListIterator
hasNext()
hasPrevious()
next()
previous()


(Q)why ListIterator is provided only in list?
(Q)Why ListIterator has extra functionalities?
(Q)Difference b/w Iterator and ListIterator
Because list maintains ordering of insertion.Set do not maintain insertion order.

=>Enumeration
hasMoreElements()
nextElement()

(Q)Diff b/w Iterator and Enumeration?
legacy interface
no remove method
faster performance than iterator,because collection is not modified using enumeration.






List interface
(1)ArrayList

Internally it uses array.If array gets fill,a new array is created with 50% more size.
Initial size of array in arrayList is 10.

Note : If array in hashtable is filled upto threadhold value,(generaly threshold is 0.75)
		then new array is created 100% more size(i.e double the original).
		Initial size of array in hashtable is 16.
Note : While calculating the index of a new element in hashtable,
		index = (size of hashtable) XOR (hashcode of key)
		eg: String s = "abc";	hashcode for s=96354
		HashMap hm=new HashMap();
		hm.put("abc","123");
		hashcode for key object "abc" = 93442
		
		int h=0;
		h ^= 96354;
		h ^= (h >>> 20) ^ (h >>> 12);
        h=h ^ (h >>> 7) ^ (h >>> 4);
		h=93442
