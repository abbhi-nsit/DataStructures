Log4j

Log4j has three main components: loggers, appenders and layouts. 

logger:
"com.foo"  is parent of "com.foo.bar"
"java" is parent of "java.util"

 Logger.getRootLogger()
 
org.apache.log4j.Level


TRACE,
DEBUG,
INFO,
WARN,
ERROR and
FATAL

FATAL > ERROR > WARN > INFO > DEBUG > TRACE

If a given logger is not assigned a level, then it inherits one from its closest ancestor with an assigned level.
The inherited level for a given logger C, is equal to the first non-null level in the logger hierarchy, 
starting at C and proceeding upwards in the hierarchy towards the root logger.

To ensure that all loggers can eventually inherit a level, the root logger always has an assigned level.


root	Proot	Proot
X		Px		Px
X.Y		none	Px
X.Y.Z	none	Px

root	Proot	Proot
X		none	Proot
X.Y		none	Proot
X.Y.Z	none	Proot



A logging request is said to be enabled if its level is higher than or equal to the level of its logger. 
Otherwise, the request is said to be disabled. 

logger.setLevel(Level.INFO);
logger.warn("will print");
logger.debug("will not print");

Appender : an output destination is called an appender

The addAppender method adds an appender to a given logger. 
Each enabled logging request for a given logger will be forwarded to all the appenders in that logger
 as well as the appenders higher in the hierarchy.
 
 root logger is assigned to console appender
 Abc logger is assinged to file appender
 
 root and its all children will append to console.
 Abc and all its children will append to file.
 
 
 Additivity in Appenders :
 
A -> B -> C -> D  (let say loggers with A as root)

log statements of C will be logged to all appenders of B and A.
this feature is additivity.
we can disable this by setting additivity=false
by default additivity=true

if we set additivity=false for B
then log statements of C will be included upto B only not in A.


layout is responsible for formatting the logging request according to the user's wishes.
