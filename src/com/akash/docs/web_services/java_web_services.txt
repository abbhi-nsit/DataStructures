JSON - javascript object notation
SOA
DOA

JAX-WS api

HttpServlet is well designed for REST style.
	doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete
	support for MIME types
	access to http headers and bodies
	
JAX-RS
	Another api for REST services
	@GET, @POST annotations
	@PATH annotations for resource
	Easy to send json or xml responses
	A layer over HttpServlet
	
Restlet
	Similar to JAX-RS
	uses annotations
	
JAX-WS
	xml centric API
	@WebService
	@WebServiceProvider
	Generaly used for SOAP applications
	
Separation of concerns
Making a web service is one concern
publishing it is another concern

Web Service
	is a distributed software system whose components can be deployed and executed on physically distinct devices
	
Conversational Patterns :
(1) Request/Response -> client sends request to server, server sends response to client
(2) Solicit/Response -> server sends message to client, then client sends messsage to server
(3) One way	-> A message from client to server with no response
(4) Notification -> A message from server to client with no response

------------------------------------------------------
SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol
REST - Representational State Transfer


Soap vs Rest

(1)Rest is based on http protocol (get,put,post,delete) , treating everything as a resource.
whereas SOAP is transport neutral. It can support HTTP, SMTP, UDP, TCP protocols.

(2)Soap works only with xml , Rest works with json/xml both.

(3)rest may/may not provide schema definition while sending messages.
It is an architectural style which has no official standard to make messages.
Soap will always provide schema definitions. 
Soap follows set of predefined rules to make SOAP messages.
It will be easy to understand request/response schema and
 their data type constraints when viewing schema information via WSDL by any client.
 
(4)Soap provides default error handling via faults.
We can also create our own custom faults.
In Rest we need to handle all error messages explicitly.

(5)The step of wsdl creation makes it difficult to make any changes in your 
schema classes while implementing in soap.
Rest implementation is quite easy, we just need to make changes in pojo classes.

(6)Soap provides SoapHandler to intercept request both at client/server side 
with both request/response.
we can use filters of j2ee or interceptors of Spring to intercept calls.

(7)Soap is fixed defined set of protocol, whereas rest is architectural style.
While implementing REST, developers can follow any rule,
 for example 
not using http protocol in well defined way.
While in Soap message part is defined as envelope.

one envelope = header + body + fault + attachment

--------------------------------------------------------

SOA -> Service Oriented Architecture

(1)Services should be loosly coupled
	S1 and S2 services should not be dependent on each other
	Any changes to one should not effect another
	
(2) Stateless function call 
	returned value by service should only depend on arguments passed to service
	
Marshelling => memory object -> some document
	java object -> xml/json
	

	
=>REST

It works on HTTP protocol
Http methods like Get, Post, Put, Delete 
MIME type like text/html
Response status code
	200 success
	404 resource not found
	303 redirect
	500 Internal server error
	401 Authentication error
	405 method not supported
Every object in REST is treated as Resource

->Http verb		Operation  Idempotent	Has-Body

POST 			Create		No			Yes
GET				Read		Yes			No
PUT				Update		Yes			Yes
Delete			Delete		Yes			No

GET request has no body.All data in GET is sent via headers.
POST request always has a body, which may be empty.

Accept : 
header information which is sent in Request object.
It specifies the MIME a client can handle.

Content-Type :
MIME type that server sends while sending reponse.
This header also includes charset.
charset specifies character encoding.
eg: Ascii, ANSI, UTF-8

Rest url example :

https://www.amazon.in/index.html

	https://www.amazon.in  => host

	index.html  => url/path/resource

	
Difference b/w PUT and POST :
PUT 
(1) creating/overriding a resource/file with specified URI.
(2) PUT to a URI , effects only that URI.
(3) Idempotent
(4) PUT always requires an Id , to be updated in URI

POST 
(1) It will make an action at server which makes
	-> effect one or more than one resource
	-> Gateway to some other protocol
(2) A post to a URI could have any effect at all.
(3) Non-Idempotent
(4) If POST do not contain any id, then a new resource with new id is created.

NOTE : Containers like tomcat/jetty do not have request.getParameter() for PUT.
