(1)equals() method in Object class checks for shallow comparison.
Custom Objects must override equals method for deep copy comparison.
Whenenver we add custom objects to List , Map or other collections ,
it internally uses these to two methods.

eg: Abc ob = new Abc();
    List listOb = new ArrayList();
	listOb.add(ob);
	listOb.contains(ob);  // this internally checks for equals method for each object in listOb
	
	equals() method can be overriden by first checking Class class object and
	 then comparing other fields of two object depending on requirement.
	e.g:
Class Test {
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	if(this == obj)
		return true;
	if((obj == null) || (obj.getClass() != this.getClass()))
		return false;
	// object must be Test at this point
	Test test = (Test)obj;
	return (id == test.id);
}
}

(2)hashCode() method

Every object in java has a hashCode. returns Integer

Why?
Because when we add any object in hashtable,hashMap,HashSet or any other hashtable like implementation,
it takes hashCode value as object hash value.

Now two objects can have same hashCode value,
that means these two objects will have hashCode collision.
So when we try find an object in hashtable , 
we first check for its hashCode and find the appropriate Linked list and 
then we try to compare each object in Linked list using equals() method.

Two equal object will always return equal hashCode value (if called more than once)
 unless no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified.

Rule (1) If two objects are equal then their hashCode are same and equals() will return true.
(2)There may be a case where two different objects have same hashCode value
 but their equals() will return false.
(3)Either both equals() and hashCode() are overridden or none in our custom class.

Note:
Default implementation of equals() checks for shallow comparison.

public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	return this==obj;
}

By defalut hashCode() method in Object class implemented
 by converting the internal address of the object into an integer.
