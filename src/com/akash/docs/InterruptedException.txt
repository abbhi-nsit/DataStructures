InterruptedException
This is an exception that sleep throws when another thread interrupts the current thread while sleep is active.

designed to cancel their current operation and return immediately when an interrupt is received.

void	interrupt()
static boolean	interrupted()
boolean	isInterrupted()

(1)interrupt()
If any thread is waiting in blocked pool because of wait(),join() or sleep() ,
then after calling this method thread will be moved to runnable pool.
whenever Thread.interrupt() method is called it sets interrupt status.

(2)interrupted()
	if Thread.interrupt() was called
	then
		interrupt status is cleared , return true
		if this method were to be called twice in succession, the second call would return false
		

(3)isInterrupted()
    return the interrupt status 
	does not change the interrupt status flag.
	
	
==============

JOIN

t.join()

causes the current thread to pause execution until t's thread terminates.
dependent on OS
responds to an interrupt by exiting with an InterruptedException.

=====================

(Q)Why stop() method is deprecated ?
It stops the thread by removing all monitors of the object.This may cause the monitor object to be in an
inconsistent state.If later this object is used by some other thread ,may lead to arbitrary behaviour.

(Q)Why destroy() method is deprecated?
It stops the thread without any clean up process.If thread had earlier held any monitor,
then that monitor cannot be used by any other thread.That can cause Deadlock.
