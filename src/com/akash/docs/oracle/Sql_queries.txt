create table student 
(

(Q) find max marks of each subject
select subject, max(marks) from student group by subject;

(Q) find topper of each subject
select s1.* from student s1, (select subject, max(marks) as marks from student group by subject)  s2
where s1.subject=s2.subject and s1.marks=s2.marks;

(Q) find topper of class
select S.* from (
select name, avg(marks) as marks from student group by name order by marks desc 
) S where ROWNUM = 1;

(Q) find max id of a table  // rownum
select * from 
(select * from student order by id )
where rownum=1;

(Q) find 3rd highest in ENG

select * from 
  (select * from 
    (select * from student order by marks desc )
   where rownum=3)
 where rownum=1;
 
 
(Q) group is applied to return a single for each group
below methods can be applied on group
 AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM
 
--(Q) Merge performs an UPDATE if a row exists, or an INSERT if the row does not exist.

Select Projections from table/subquery
 	where Clause 
 	group by column 
 	having conditions_on_groups
 	
 
 (Q) get all names of student
 
 select distinct(name) from student
 
 (Q) Diff b/w char and varchar2
 char size is fixed and uses all space
 
 (Q) What is view and what are its usage
 view is data taken from one or multiple tables
 
 (Q) methods that can be applied on columns
 SUBSTRING , UPPER, LOWER
 
 (Q) Types of Join
 inner join
 left join
 right join
 full join
 
 (Q) Delete , Truncate and Drop
 
 delete - it deletes data with some condition, all rows can be deleted
 			saves transaction logs, updates indexes, hence takes time
 			slower
 			can be rollbacked
 			DML command
 			
 Trancate - it deletes all data of table except table structure
 			faster than delete
 			DDL
 			cannot be rollbacked
 			
 Drop	- delete all rows and table columns
 
 (Q) Disadvantages of using IN clause
 	IN clause does hard parsing and compile query for every different list size
 	Maximum list size supported by oracle in IN clause = 1000 , for more than that it will throw runtime exception
 	
(Q) With clause
he WITH clause may be processed as an inline view or resolved as a temporary table. 
The advantage of the latter is that repeated references to the subquery may be more efficient
 as the data is easily retrieved from the temporary table, 
 rather than being requeried by each reference.
 
 WITH N1 AS 
 (select * from table),
 N2 AS 
 (select * from N1),
 N3 AS 
 (select * from N2)
 select * from N3;
